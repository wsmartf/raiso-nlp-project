To get this working:

1. Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:wsmartf/raiso-nlp-project.git`
2. Create a venv called "env": `python3 -m venv env`
3. Install openAI: `pip install openai`
4. Paste api key into line 4
5. Run the code: `python3 test.py`

If you want to make changes, make a new branch, commit your changes, and push to that branch. Feel free to ask any questions in slack.

Goals for this week:
- Make api response and get good results, comparable to ChatGPT interface.
- Make a basic web UI that takes a text input and shows the GPT output.
- Get DALL-E working to some extent.
